# GENERIC METHODS ---------------------------------------------------------

#' Function to obtain a new neighbor in a neighborhood
#' 
#' This is one of the functions that has to be implemented by any object to be used as a neighborhood
#' 
#' @family neighborhoods
#' @param neighborhood Object representing the neighborhood
#' @return A new solution in th neighborhood represented by \code{neighborhood}
#' @seealso \code{\link{hasMoreNeighbors}} \code{\link{resetNeighborhood}}
setGeneric(name = "next.neighbor", def = function(neighborhood){standardGeneric("next.neighbor")})


#' Function to check whether we have accessed to all the solutions in the neighborhood or not
#' 
#' This is one of the functions that has to be implemented by any object to be used as a neighborhood
#' 
#' @family neighborhoods
#' @param neighborhood Object representing the neighborhood
#' @return \code{TRUE} if there are more solutions to explore, \case{FALSE} in other case
#' @seealso \code{\link{nextNeighbor}} \code{\link{resetNeighborhood}}
setGeneric(name = "has.more.neighbors", def = function(neighborhood){standardGeneric("has.more.neighbors")})

#' Function to reset a neighborhood to a given base solution
#' 
#' This is one of the functions that has to be implemented by any object to be used as a neighborhood
#' 
#' @family neighborhoods
#' @param neighborhood Object representing the neighborhood
#' @param solution Solution whose neighborhood we want to explore
#' @seealso \code{\link{nextNeighbor}} \code{\link{resetNeighborhood}}
